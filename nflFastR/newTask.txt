I have an R script that is located at nflFastR/third_down_stats.R. This is a script that pulls data from nflFastR and preforms task on and with that data. It also uses some user built libraries/packages like load_participation from nflReader. first thing please review this R script and get a good understanding for what it is doing. there are several .txt files in my nflFastR directory that contain various pages from the nflFastr and nflreader docs. please reference these txt files to aid you in your task. also perfrom web searches whenever you feel it would be beneficial. when you have a very firm grasp of what excatly this script is doing and reviewed all documentation and done any relevant web searches for context please work on the following task(s):

IMPORTANT: DO NOT DO ANY DATABASE MIGRATIONS OR PREFROM ANY ACTUAL DATABASE OPERTATIONS AT THIS TIME! WE ARE GETTING DATA READY FOR A FUTURE DATA MIGRATION BUT NOT DOING ANY DATABASE OPERATIONS TODAY!

new task:

right now there is a file nflFastR/processStats.ts that is prefroming several data operations. it takes in data from nflFastR/third_down_stats and also preforms its own queries and operations on nflFastR. it is supposed to combine the data it finds with the data from nflFastR/third_down_stats to make one object for seasons that has one object for every player in every season with all the data for that player in that season from both nflFastR/third_down_stats and nflFastR/processStats.ts. the problem is this isn't working and I don't like the approach. can you move all the logic for getting and compiling seasons data in one file (nflFastR/third_down_stats) and do all operations there and have it return (and make a CSV) of one object that contains all the seasons data I want. please make a console log at the end of this file that logs the last 10 entires when the file is ran so I can see the output. run that R script when you are done
