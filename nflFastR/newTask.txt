I have an R script that is located at nflFastR/third_down_stats.R. This is a script that pulls data from nflFastR and preforms task on and with that data. It also uses some user built libraries/packages like load_participation from nflReader. first thing please review this R script and get a good understanding for what it is doing. there are several .txt files in my nflFastR directory that contain various pages from the nflFastr and nflreader docs. please reference these txt files to aid you in your task. also perfrom web searches whenever you feel it would be beneficial. when you have a very firm grasp of what excatly this script is doing and reviewed all documentation and done any relevant web searches for context please work on the folliwng task(s):

The CPOE numbers for quarterbacks still looks like a cumulative total when it needs to be a cumulative average calculated across the season. 

The weather related data points are still not working properly either. you can get fantasy points scored in the game by the player from playerGameStats that is calculated in the nflFastR/processStats.ts file. this brings us to a bigger point. everything we are calculatin in third_down_stats.R is season long data for the players and getting a single object for each player in each season they played. Currently we are building datasets for players seasons and one for player games in processStats.ts and are sending data for each of those to the database. ultimatley we just want three databases in the database. one for player seasons with 1 object that has all the season long stats (some totals, some averages) for each player in each season, one for player games that has one object for each player that has all their data points for that game for each game, and one for team seasons that will have one object for each team for each season with all the team level stats for that team in that season. 

so all the season long data objects we are building for each player in third_down_stats.R  should be merged with the matching players matching season object from PlayerSeasonStats. we also want to start building the team seasons objects and a prisma schema for that database. 

IMPORTANT: DO NOT DO ANY DATABASE MIGRATIONS OR PREFROM ANY ACTUAL DATABASE OPERTATIONS AT THIS TIME! WE ARE GETTING DATA READY FOR A FUTURE DATA MIGRATION BUT NOT DOING ANY DATABASE OPERATIONS TODAY!
